Functions describe the relationship between two sets, assigning each input exactly one output. They are central to almost every area of mathematics and real-world modeling.
Important aspects of functions:
- The domain is the set of all possible input values.
- The range is the set of all possible output values.
- Functions can be represented as equations (e.g., f(x) = xÂ²), graphs, or tables.
Types of functions:
- Linear functions have constant rates of change.
- Quadratic functions form parabolas and involve squared terms.
- Exponential functions grow rapidly and are key in fields like biology and finance.
