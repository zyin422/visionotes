Chemical bonds are the forces that hold atoms together in compounds and molecules. They form when atoms share or transfer electrons to achieve a more stable electron configuration.
Major types of bonds:
- Ionic bonds occur when electrons are transferred from one atom to another, forming charged ions (e.g., NaCl).
- Covalent bonds form when two atoms share electrons (e.g., Hâ‚‚O).
- Metallic bonds involve a 'sea' of shared electrons moving freely among metal ions.
Bond properties like polarity, bond length, and bond energy influence the behavior and reactivity of substances.
