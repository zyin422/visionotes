The Industrial Revolution was a period of major industrialization during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, beginning in Britain and spreading worldwide. It transformed economies from farming-based to manufacturing-based.
Key changes:
- Introduction of machines like the spinning jenny and steam engine.
- Growth of factories leading to mass production.
- Urbanization as people moved to cities for work.
Social impacts included improved transportation, rising living standards for some, and harsh working conditions that eventually led to labor reforms.
