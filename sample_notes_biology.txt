Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. The process primarily takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells.
The overall chemical reaction is:
6CO2+6H2O+light→C6H12O6+6O26CO_2 + 6H_2O + light \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_26CO2​+6H2​O+light→C6​H12​O6​+6O2​
There are two main stages of photosynthesis:
Light-dependent reactions: These occur in the thylakoid membranes and involve the conversion of light energy into ATP and NADPH.
Calvin Cycle (light-independent reactions): Takes place in the stroma and is responsible for synthesizing glucose using ATP, NADPH, and CO₂.
Chlorophyll is the primary pigment involved, absorbing mostly blue and red light while reflecting green.
