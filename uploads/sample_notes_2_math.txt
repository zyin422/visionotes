Polynomials are algebraic expressions made up of variables and coefficients, involving terms added, subtracted, and multiplied. They are essential in algebra, calculus, and real-world problem modeling.
Important features:
- Degree: The highest power of the variable (e.g., xÂ³ in a cubic polynomial).
- Leading coefficient: The coefficient of the highest degree term.
- Zeros (roots): The values of x that make the polynomial equal to zero.
Basic operations include adding, subtracting, and multiplying polynomials, and they can be factored to find solutions to equations.
