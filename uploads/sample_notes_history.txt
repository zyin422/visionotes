The American Revolution was the colonial revolt between 1775 and 1783 in which the Thirteen Colonies won independence from Great Britain. It led to the founding of the United States of America.
Key causes of the revolution:
- "No taxation without representation" angered colonists over British taxes.
- The Boston Tea Party protested unfair trade laws.
- The Intolerable Acts pushed many colonies to rebellion.
Major events:
- Battles of Lexington and Concord marked the start.
- The Declaration of Independence (1776) formally announced separation.
- Victory at Yorktown (1781) ended major fighting, leading to the Treaty of Paris.
