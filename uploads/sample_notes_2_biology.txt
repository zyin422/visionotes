Cellular respiration is the process by which cells convert glucose and oxygen into energy, carbon dioxide, and water.
It primarily occurs in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells.
The overall chemical reaction is: C6H12O6 + 6O2 â†’ 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy (ATP).
There are three main stages of cellular respiration: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain.
Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm and breaks down glucose into pyruvate, producing a small amount of ATP.
The Krebs cycle takes place in the mitochondrial matrix and generates electron carriers like NADH and FADH2.
The electron transport chain occurs across the inner mitochondrial membrane and produces the majority of ATP.
Oxygen is the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, forming water as a byproduct.
