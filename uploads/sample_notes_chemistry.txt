The periodic table is a chart that arranges all known chemical elements by increasing atomic number. Elements with similar properties are grouped together into columns known as groups or families.
The general layout:
- Metals are found on the left and center; they are good conductors of heat and electricity.
- Nonmetals are located on the right and include important gases like oxygen and nitrogen.
- Metalloids form a staircase between metals and nonmetals and have properties of both.
Periodic trends include:
- Atomic radius decreases across a period but increases down a group.
- Ionization energy generally increases across a period and decreases down a group.
- Electronegativity also shows periodic trends important for chemical bonding.
